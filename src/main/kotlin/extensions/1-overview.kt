package extensions

// Way of extending existing classes with new functionality without any wrappers,
// using inheritance or OOP patterns (Decorators)

// After defining we can use it as simply as part of the original API

// Thanks to them, we can make our code easier to read and more maintainable.
// We can focus on adding logic specific to our needs rather that creating wrappers that serve just as boilerplate

// Scope functions that we learned a week ago are extensions too :3

// Kotlin adds enormous amount of extension functions to Java collections and String class
// That's why we can do some cool stuff on them like associating, zipping, grouping, partitioning, etc.
