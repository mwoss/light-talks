package scopes

// Scope function - execute block of code within some context

// We can live without them, but they can make code much more readable and easy to write

// Main difference: context of the scope function and return value

// Try to not overuse them. They were created for making code more readable and concise,
// but spamming them everywhere and nesting multiple scope function in each other can make code unbelievably
// hard to read, especially when you mix scope functions that use different object contexts (this/it).
