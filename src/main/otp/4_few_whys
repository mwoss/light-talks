Q: So why those numbers are more secure than old-school password?
A: This additional layer of security makes a life harder for attackers.
   If an attacker somehow manages to intercept the code, this method prevents they from guessing the next code unless they known to the secret key.
   Also OTP is synced between two entities without need of communication through internet (potential medium of attacks).
   But OTP is still vulnerable to phishing attacks.

Q: Why if our device is out of sync with server?
A: Oh, that's bad XD But not much if we are not extremely out of sync.
   Most of OTP servers compute OTP for few previous and next counter values. So if we are out of sync a bit, we could still log in :3
   RFC 6238 suggests a default of Â±2 time windows.
   Server usually logs if we were out of sync and try to sync.


Q: Sometimes the OTP expire but I'm able to log in, why?
A: Answered above. Server calculate usually calculates OTP for t-1, t, t+1


Q: Why don't we just take first 4 bytes from HMAC-SHA1? Why do we have to take those 4 lower bits for offset?
A: Mostly, the thing from the past. Researchers hope if there was an attack (e.g. time-space)
   that lets you compute just the first 4-bytes of a hash cheaper, the entire algorithm would fail.
   You are just forced to compute the entire hash.
   Btw it's not longer true, but RFC is from 2005, cryptography progressed a lot in those 17 years.

Q: Is OTP
